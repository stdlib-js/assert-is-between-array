> Test if a value is an array-like object where every element is between two values.

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/assert-is-between-array
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm` branch][esm-url].
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno` branch][deno-url].
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd` branch][umd-url].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var isBetweenArray = require( '@stdlib/assert-is-between-array' );
```

#### isBetweenArray( value, a, b\[, left, right] )

Tests if a `value` is an array-like `object` where every element is between two values `a` (left comparison value) and `b` (right comparison value).

```javascript
var arr = [ 3, 4, 5 ];

var bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 5 );
// returns true

bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 4, 5 );
// returns false

bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 4 );
// returns false
```

By default, the function assumes that `a` and `b` are inclusive.

```javascript
var arr = [ 3, 4, 5 ];

var bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 5 );
// returns true

bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 5, 'closed', 'closed' );
// returns true
```

To make `a` and/or `b` exclusive, set the respective arguments to `'open'`.

```javascript
var arr = [ 3, 4, 5 ];

var bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 5, 'open', 'closed' );
// returns false

bool = isBetweenArray( arr, 3, 5, 'closed', 'open' );
// returns false
```

## Notes

-   If `a` and `b` are inclusive, the element-wise comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a <= v_i <= b
    ```

-   If `a` is exclusive and `b` is inclusive, the element-wise comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a < v_i <= b
    ```

-   If `a` is inclusive and `b` is exclusive, the element-wise comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a <= v_i < b
    ```

-   If `a` and `b` are exclusive, the element-wise comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a < v_i < b
    ```

-   If provided an empty array-like `object`, the function returns `false`.

    ```javascript
    var bool = isBetweenArray( [], 0.0, 1.0 );
    // returns false
    ```

-   If provided non-numeric values, element-wise comparisons are performed according to lexicographic order.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random-base-randu' );
var filledarrayBy = require( '@stdlib/array-filled-by' );
var isBetweenArray = require( '@stdlib/assert-is-between-array' );

// Create an array of random numbers:
var x = filledarrayBy( 100, 'float64', randu );

// Check whether every element resides within the interval [0.01, 0.99]:
var bool = isBetweenArray( x, 0.01, 0.99 );
console.log( bool );
